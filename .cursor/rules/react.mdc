# React Rules

## File Patterns

- **/*.ts
- **/*.tsx

## Code Style and Structure

- Use named exports for components
- Use `const` instead of `function` for components
- Ensure all components have a TypeScript interface using `React.FC`
- Prefix event handler functions with "handle" (e.g., handleClick, handleKeyDown)
- Component props should have a defined type that matches the component name and ends in `Props`
