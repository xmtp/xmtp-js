Thank you for considering contributing to this repo! Community contributions like yours are key to the development and adoption of XMTP. Your questions, feedback, suggestions, and code contributions are welcome!

## ‚ùî Questions

Have a question about how to build with XMTP? Ask your question and learn with the community in the [XMTP Community Forums](https://community.xmtp.org/).

## üêû Bugs

Report a bug using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/issues).

## ‚ú® Feature Requests

Request a feature using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/issues).

## üîÄ Pull Requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-0-xip-purpose-process-guidelines/475) before work begins.

After a pull request is submitted, a single approval is required to merge it.

## üîß Developing

### Prerequisites

#### Node

Please make sure you have a compatible version as specified in `package.json`. We recommend using a Node version manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv).

#### Yarn

This repository uses the [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/). To use it, enable [Corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack), if it isn't already, by running `corepack enable`.

### Useful commands

- `yarn`: Installs all dependencies
- `yarn bench`: Run the benchmarking suite
- `yarn build`: Builds the JS SDK
- `yarn format`: Run prettier format and write changes
- `yarn format:check`: Run prettier format check
- `yarn test`: Run the unit test suite
- `yarn test:setup`: Start a local development node using Docker (only needs to be run once)
- `yarn lint`: Lint with ESLint
- `yarn typecheck`: Typecheck with `tsc`

### Testing and validation

Please add unit tests when appropriate and ensure that all unit tests are passing before submitting a pull request. Note that some unit tests require a backend node to be running locally. The `test:setup` command can be run a single time to start the node in the background using Docker.

Manual validation requires setting up a client app such as the [example app](https://github.com/xmtp/example-chat-react). Once you have cloned and run the example app, it will use a published npm version of `xmtp-js` by default. You can point it to your local `xmtp-js` repository by using `yarn link` or `npm link` from the `example-chat-react` directory, which will update its `package.json`. Once the example app is running, any further changes you make to `xmtp-js` will be reflected in the app after you run `yarn build` in the `xmtp-js` directory and then reload the app.

### Auto-releasing and commit conventions

A new version of this package will be automatically published whenever there is a merge to the `main` branch. Specifically, new GitHub releases and tags will be created, and a new NPM package version will be published. The release version increment type is derived from the format of the commit messages that were bundled in the merge to `main`, using [semantic-release commit message conventions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format).

The table below shows example commits and the resulting release type for a `pencil` project:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs: describe scribble feature` | No Release |
| `test: fix failing unit test` | No Release |
| `fix: stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied` | ~~Patch~~ Fix Release |
| `feat: add 'graphiteWidth' option` | ~~Minor~~ Feature Release |
| `perf: remove graphiteWidth option`<br><br>`BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.`<br>`The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release <br /> (Note that the `BREAKING CHANGE:` token must be in the footer of the commit) |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

This is currently configured to use the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format). e.g. `feat: add message signing` would cause a minor release.

If there are multiple commits within a single pull request, each commit will be listed as a separate bullet point in the [release notes](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases) and bundled together in a release of the highest increment type specified.

If your commit messages are not to your liking, it is permitted to rewrite the history on your branch and force-push it before merging it. Make sure you are never force-pushing on `main`, and that the following is in your `~/.gitconfig` file.

```
[push]
	default = simple
```
