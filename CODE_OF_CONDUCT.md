# XMTP code of conduct

This code of conduct applies within all XMTP community spaces, virtual and physical, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the XMTP community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Our pledge

We as members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our conduct

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being collaborative and respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. A great protocol is built by many contributors learning and working together.
- Being bold yet intentional when presenting ideas. We are here to help ensure the world has access to secure and private communication, while also acknowledging that building successful protocols and ecosystems requires the application of logic and evidence.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community, and the people depending on XMTP for communication.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Hate speech, trolling, shitposting, flaming, spamming, unsolicited advertising, baiting, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Moderation

Community moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to the community moderators responsible for enforcement at [conduct@xmtp.org](mailto:conduct@xmtp.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. All community moderators are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Community moderators who do not follow or enforce the code of conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other community moderators.
