## Developing

Run `yarn dev` to build the SDK and watch for changes, which will trigger a rebuild.

### Useful commands

- `yarn build`: Builds the SDK
- `yarn clean`: Removes `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.turbo` folders

## Breaking revisions

Because this SDK is in active development, you should expect breaking revisions that might require you to adopt the latest SDK release to enable your app to continue working as expected.

Breaking revisions in a Node SDK release are described on the [Releases page](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/releases).

## Deprecation

Older versions of the SDK will eventually be deprecated, which means:

1. The network will not support and eventually actively reject connections from clients using deprecated versions.
2. Bugs will not be fixed in deprecated versions.

The following table provides the deprecation schedule.
