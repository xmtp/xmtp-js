## Features

### Event-driven architecture

Subscribe to specific events and receive only the ones that matter to you using Node's `EventEmitter`:

```ts
agent.on("message", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.send("Hello!");
});
```

### Middleware support

Build flexible middleware pipelines by composing the tools you need (Custom Filters, Telemetry, Analytics, â€¦):

```ts
const router = new CommandRouter();

router.command("/start", async (ctx) => {
  await ctx.conversation.send("ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your XMTP agent!");
});

const agent = new Agent({ client });
agent.use(router.middleware());
```

### Built-in Filters

Skip repetitive condition checks with ready-to-use message filters, easily chained through a fluent API:

```ts
agent.on(
  "message",
  withFilter(filter.and(filter.notFromSelf, filter.textOnly), async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.conversation.send("Hey!");
  }),
);
```
