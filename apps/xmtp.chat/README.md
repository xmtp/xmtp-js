# xmtp.chat app

Use this React app as a tool to start building an app with XMTP.

The app is built using the [XMTP client browser SDK](/sdks/browser-sdk/README.md), [React](https://react.dev/), and [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).

To keep up with the latest React app developments, see the [Issues tab](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js/issues) in this repo.

To learn more about XMTP and get answers to frequently asked questions, see the [XMTP documentation](https://xmtp.org/docs).

### Limitations

This React app isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.

## Useful commands

- `yarn clean`: Removes `node_modules` and `.turbo` folders
- `yarn dev`: Runs the app in development mode
- `yarn typecheck`: Runs `tsc`
