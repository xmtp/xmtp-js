        Thank you for taking the time to report a bug. Community contributions like yours are key to the development and adoption of XMTP. Review the following guidelines for reporting a bug:
          - Include 1 bug per issue. Creating 1 issue per bug will make it easier to assign and track progress on bugs.
          - Check existing issues to see if your issue has already been reported.
          - Ensure that the bug is not security-related and can safely be disclosed publicly on GitHub. For information about how to report a security issue, see the **Security** tab in this repo.
          - Follow the [XMTP code of conduct](https://xmtp.org/community/code-of-conduct).
